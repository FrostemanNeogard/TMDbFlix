## Note: There is currently a CORS bug causing movies to not display on the 'Discover' tab when on the production link.

## About this project

This is an application which uses the TMDb API to display information about movies in a style similar to streaming services such as Netflix or Disney+. It is built with React and was mainly created as a way to learn more about using APIs as well as being an excuse to create and style layouts which I have not had the chance to do prior to this.
